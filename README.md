I have created a clone of the NYT game "Wordle." This game gives you six chances to guess a five letter word while giving you feedback and hints after each guess.
This game has personal significance as I play this game everyday with some of my friends. It is a fun way to feel connected and make sure we are having some sort of interaction
with eachother everyday, even if it's just a competitive nudge to see who did better.

The rules to the game are simple. After each guess you will receive visual feedback to help you get closer to the target word.
A yellow background means the letter is present in the target word but NOT in the correct place.
A green background means the letter is present in the target word AND in the correct place.
Any letters that return grey mean they are not in the target word at all.

Technologies used to develope this game were HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Next steps to improve this game would be the addition of a visual keyboard on screen for players to keep track of which letters they have already guessed, including the feedback
of the letter turning green, yellow, or grey.

Attributions: to develop this game I employed an array of all five letter words in the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
